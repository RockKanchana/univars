I am Gayasha Thilakarathna, I work for Sri Lankan airlines as a cabin crew member since 2011. As a cabin crew member, I understand the importance of providing exceptional service, which is the key component of the hospitality world. My decision to pursue an HND in Hospitality Management was driven by my passion for the industry and my aspiration to excel in a dynamic and customer-oriented field. While I was choosing a campus to start my studies the first campus came to my mind was the ESOFT Metro Campus.\nThe curriculum, expertly designed by ESOFT Metro Campus and delivered by dedicated educators, provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various facets of hospitality, from service excellence to event management. The practical exposure gained during this HND program not only equipped me with the essential skills and knowledge but also shaped my character and outlook towards the world of hospitality. The program enhanced my ability to provide exceptional service in the aviation industry. The skills in communication, problem-solving, and teamwork that I honed during my studies have been tremendously helpful in my career growth.\nTo my fellow graduates, I say this: let our graduation be a reminder that with hard work, dedication, and a passion for learning.\nI would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my professors, classmates, and everyone who played a role in my educational journey. My HND graduation ceremony is not just a celebration of academic achievement but also a testament to the power of perseverance and passion. I am excited to see where this journey takes me, and I am eager to continue making a difference in the world of hospitality and beyond. Thank you all for being a part of my remarkable journey.\n\nHi.

Their dedication to imparting knowledge and fostering critical thinking left an indelible mark on me. Their willingness to go above and above by answering to my questions and assisting me with challenging concepts was crucial to my academic success.\nI was actively involved in a number of extracurricular activities at ESOFT, among them, being appointed as the secretary of the student Association Kurunegala for the year 2023 gave me a huge opportunity to develop my leadership skills and to network with other students. These experiences helped me develop essential soft skills, such as leadership, teamwork, and communication, which have proven invaluable in my career.\nBefore completing my degree, I was recruited as a banking assistant by the Deutsche bank, a well reputed multinational bank in Sri Lanka. The knowledge and skills I gained during my HND program have played a pivotal role in my professional journey. Whether it\'s problem-solving, critical thinking, or effective communication, my education has equipped me to excel in my field.
